@types/Foundry-vtt

A limited library of typescript type definitions I've made for foundry virtual table top. 
I've found the type documentation for a lot of foundry's classes, properties and parameters to be rather limited. T
his project intends to add type definitions based off of actual usage rather than intended usage or vague "Object" types.
